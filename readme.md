# Loan Billing API  

A **Node.js + Express** API for managing loans, payment schedules, and borrower transactions. The API supports loan creation, payment tracking, delinquency detection, and more. It uses **PostgreSQL + Sequelize** as the database.  



## Assumptions  

1. **Borrower can only have 1 loan at a time.**  
2. **Borrower can only pay the due amount and cannot pay future payments.**  


## Database Schema  

The database consists of the following tables:  

- **Loan** → Stores loan details (one per borrower).  
- **Schedule** → Stores the payment schedule for each loan.  
- **Transaction** → Records actual payments made by the borrower.  
- **TransactionSchedule** → Links transactions to scheduled payments.
